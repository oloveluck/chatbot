Monkeys are part of the primate family, which also includes humans, apes, and lemurs.

There are currently known to be 264 different species of monkeys.

Monkeys are divided into two major groups: Old World monkeys that live in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys that live in South America.

A group of monkeys is known as a 'troop'.

Monkeys are very social creatures. Groups of monkeys often play and sleep together, and they have intricate social structures.

Some monkeys live primarily on the ground, like baboons, while others live in trees, such as spider monkeys.

The smallest monkey in the world is the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 5 inches (13 cm) in length and 2 ounces (56 grams) in weight.

The largest monkey is the mandrill, with a male mandrill reaching about 3 feet (91 cm) in length and weighing up to 77 pounds (35 kg).

Many monkeys have prehensile tails, which can be used to grasp or hold objects. The spider monkey and capuchin monkey are examples of New World monkeys that have prehensile tails.

Monkeys are intelligent and capable of using tools. For example, capuchin monkeys are known to use rocks as tools to crack nuts.

Certain species of monkeys have learned to live with humans and are often seen in busy cities. The rhesus macaque is one such example, especially in India.

Many monkeys are omnivorous. While they have a diet consisting mostly of fruit, they also eat vegetables, insects, and occasionally meat.

Some monkeys, like the howler monkeys, are known for their loud calls that can be heard for up to 3 miles (4.8 km) in the rainforest.

A few species of monkeys, such as the Colobus monkeys, do not have thumbs.

The gestation period of monkeys varies by species but averages between 4 to 8 months. Some smaller monkeys, like marmosets, have gestation periods of about 4 to 5 months, while larger monkeys like baboons have a gestation period of about 6 months.
